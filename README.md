# Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project for the CodingNomads Python Course. 

In this project I gather data from Twitter using Tweepy, make a Twitter Bot, and use functions to find:

- The average number of followers.
- The average length of tweets (counting words).
- The average length of tweets (counting characters).
- The percentage of tweets that have a hashtag (#).
- The percentage of tweets that have a mention (@).
- The 100 most common words.
- The 100 most common symbols.
- Percentage of tweets that use punctuation.
- The longest word in a tweet.
- Shortest word in a tweet.
- What user has the most tweets in the dataset.
- The average number of tweets from an individual user.
- The hour with the greatest number of tweets.
