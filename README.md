# Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project for the CodingNomads Python Course. In this project I gather data from Twitter using Tweepy, make a Twitter Bot, and use functions to find:

The average number of followers.
The average length of tweets (counting words).
The average length of tweets (counting characters).
The percentage of tweets that have a hashtag (#).
The percentage of tweets that have a mention (@).
The 100 most common words.
The 100 most common symbols.
Percentage of tweets that use punctuation.
The longest word in a tweet.
Shortest word in a tweet.
What user has the most tweets in the dataset.
The average number of tweets from an individual user.
The hour with the greatest number of tweets.
